# Dynamic-Pricing-for-Urban-Parking-Lots
# Overview
This project simulates dynamic pricing strategies for urban parking spaces using real-time occupancy data and competitive pricing intelligence. The goal is to optimize parking lot revenue while maintaining fairness and responsiveness in pricing.

Three models are implemented and evaluated:

Model 1: Linear Pricing — A static pricing model using fixed base logic.

Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing — Adjusts prices based on occupancy levels and estimated demand.

Model 3: Competitive Pricing — Enhances Model 2 by incorporating competitor prices and location-based competition awareness.

Performance is evaluated based on total revenue, price fairness, and responsiveness.
