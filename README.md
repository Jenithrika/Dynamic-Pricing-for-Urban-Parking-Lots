# Dynamic-Pricing-for-Urban-Parking-Lots
# Overview
This project simulates dynamic pricing strategies for urban parking spaces using real-time occupancy data and competitive pricing intelligence. The goal is to optimize parking lot revenue while maintaining fairness and responsiveness in pricing.

Three models are implemented and evaluated:

Model 1: Linear Pricing â€” A static pricing model using fixed base logic.

Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing â€” Adjusts prices based on occupancy levels and estimated demand.

Model 3: Competitive Pricing â€” Enhances Model 2 by incorporating competitor prices and location-based competition awareness.

Performance is evaluated based on total revenue, price fairness, and responsiveness.

#  Project Architecture and Workflow
The project simulates a dynamic pricing system for urban parking using real-time demand signals, competitive positioning, and pricing rules. Here's how the entire pipeline flows:

## 1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
Input Source: Live or simulated real-time data stream from Pathway (model2_window).

Features: Includes SystemCodeNumber, price, occupancy, capacity, timestamp, latitude, longitude, and derived norm_demand.

Preprocessing:

Timestamps are parsed.

Dates are extracted.

Static location data is merged.

Unique sorted dates are used to build a map of previous dates (for lagged logic).

## 2. Model 1 â€“ Linear Pricing
A simple benchmark model using a linear pricing formula.

Prices are computed based on fixed multipliers on demand.

## 3. Model 2 â€“ Demand-Based Pricing
Incorporates real-time occupancy-to-capacity ratio and norm_demand.

Prices increase with high demand and decrease when demand is low.

Enforces a price floor and cap to keep prices realistic.

## 4. Model 3 â€“ Competitive Pricing Model
Location intelligence is used to determine nearby competitors (within 1 km radius).

Uses previous day's competitor prices as a proxy for market rates.

Adjusts pricing using clear business rules:

If the lot is full and competitors are cheaper â†’ reduce price slightly.

If demand is high and competitors are expensive â†’ raise price moderately.

In low-demand zones, avoid overpricing.

Neutral price band prevents overreaction to small fluctuations.

## 5. Price Adjustment Logic
Final prices are adjusted in Adjusted_Price based on:

Occupancy conditions

Competitive undercut/overpricing scenarios

Market responsiveness

A safeguard ensures prices stay between â‚¹10 and â‚¹20

## 6. Evaluation
All models are compared based on:

Total Revenue generation

% of time the model undercut competitors

% of time the model was overpriced

Smart pricing opportunities captured

Model 3 performs nearly as well as Model 2 in terms of revenue but offers better business realism and market adaptiveness.

## 7. Visualization
Visualisations created using Bokeh:

Time-series plots of adjusted prices across lots

Comparative price trendlines for all models

All plots are saved as a PDF document and added to the repo.

# Results
The performance of the three pricing models was evaluated based on total revenue and competitive pricing behavior.

| Model                                    | Description                      | Total Revenue (â‚¹) |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Model 1: Linear Pricing**              | Baseline, demand-independent     | â‚¹9,429,079        |
| **Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing**        | Responsive to occupancy & demand | â‚¹10,650,048       |
| **Model 3: Competitive Pricing (Final)** | Demand + competitor-aware        | â‚¹10,649,467       |

## Competitive Behavior Metrics (Model 3)

| Metric                                         | Value          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| ðŸ”» **Undercut competitors in**                 | 14.8% of cases |
| ðŸ”º **Overpriced vs competitors in**            | 47.3% of cases |
| ðŸ”¥ **Smart price hikes during high demand**    | 74 instances   |
| ðŸ’¸ **Revenue difference (Model 3 vs Model 2)** | â‚¹581 less      |

Model 3 provides a realistic, competition-aware pricing approach with minimal revenue trade-off compared to pure demand-based pricing.
